  eventsPrompt: `The murder can't have been the only event to happen. Please generate some other events that have happened between the suspects and possibly the victim, to cast suspicion in other directions. Focus on suspects other than the murderer. There should be between 3 and 5 events.
    Here is an example event object:

  cluesPrmopt: `The mystery must be solved using Clues. Clues lead the detective to solve the mystery, and must confirm who the murder was as well as the murder means, or lead the detective in the right direction. They can also hint at the motive, though this will be divulged in full when the killer is apprehended.
    For each clue, give either the clue Location or the clue Suspect, depending if the clue is something discovered at a location, something given to the detective by a suspect or just a given piece of information. A location should be a room or a building, not a person's belongings 'e.g. Amelia's Purse'.
    Also, you can include unlockingClue, if a clue needs to be shown to a suspect or used at a location (a key to unlock a safe) to gain the clue. Make sure all clues are accessible, and that unlockingClues make sense, set to null if just available.
    The unlockMeans should detail how the clue is gained by the detectives. From just finding it on the floor, to being told by the witness they're talking to.
    Here is an example object:
    {
    "name": "Load Document",
    "detail": "Details of a loan of 300 pounds given to David from Kevin 3 years ago.",
    "location": "Kevin's Study",
    "unlockingClue": null,
    "unlockMeans": "The detectives find the shattered glass on the floor of the study."
    }
    
    The example object will be
    "mysteryClues":

    "clues":[...clues in here...],

    Please don't include any extra text other before or after the object. Thank you!`,
  redHerringsPrompt: `We also need some red herring clues to lead to the other events listed above. These share the same format as a clue, except include the name of an event, and at least 1 revealSuspect to reveal the details of the event when presented with the clue (must be different from the supply suspect).
    Here is an example herring clue:
    {
      "name": "A shattered glass",
      "detail": "A shattered glass found in Kevin's study."

      "unlockingClue": null,

  locationPrompt: `Now it is time to firm up the set of locations for this mystery. There should be at least 8 locations, one of which must be the crime scene. These are the different locations the mystery takes place between. 
    Each location should have a name, and a description, and a list of the names of the neighboring places. Make sure all places can be accessed, and that neighboring places make sense. Each location should neighbor at least one other location.
    Locations can also have charactersPresent, which is a list of the names of the characters present at the location. All suspects must be present at one location.
    {
    "location": "The Kitchen",
    "description": "The kitchen was spotlessly clean, lit by flicking iridescent light bulbs that looked as though they should've been replaced decades ago."

  suspectLocationsPrompt: `For suspect's locations, please generate an object with the key being a suspect's name, and the value being the location name. Every listed suspect must be in one of the listed locations.

  introductionPrompt: `It's time to generate the introduction. Write an introduction to the story introducing the setting, the detectives arrival on the scene, why they are there (are they just aboard the train, have the police called them in, is there a personal reason they are investigating the case?)
    Write in the style of a murder mystery novel, and take the time to set the scene as the detectives arrive. The introduction should end with the detective in the location where the crime occured, and just about to investigate.
    
    Please return this in a json object, containing introductionText, which is an array of paragraph length strings.
    
    Example object:
    introduction: {
